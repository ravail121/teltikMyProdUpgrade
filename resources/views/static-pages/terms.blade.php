        <p dir="ltr">Teltik Communications Mobile Service Terms and Conditions:</p>
        <p dir="ltr"></p>
        <p dir="ltr">Effective December 2020.</p>
<p dir="ltr" ><span >These Terms and Conditions (&quot;T&amp;Cs&quot;) are a legally binding agreement between you and Teltik Communications Inc, a New Jersey based company, including its affiliates, assignees, and agents (&quot;Teltik Communications&quot;). Please read these T&amp;Cs carefully. They cover important information about the Teltik Communications mobile phone services provided to you (the &quot;Service&quot;); your phone, handset, device, SIM card, data card, or other equipment or third party device which may be used with our Service (the &quot;Devices&quot;); and the fees, taxes, and other charges you pay us (&quot;Charges&quot;). These T&amp;Cs include, among other provisions, fees for late payments, limitations of liability, agreements regarding privacy, and resolution of disputes by arbitration instead of in court.</span><span ><br></span><span >Teltik Communications reserves the right to change or modify any of these T&amp;Cs at any time and in its sole discretion. Teltik Communications will provide 14 days notice of any material changes by posting the revised T&amp;Cs on our website, and will also attempt to provide direct notice to you by email or text. Teltik Communications affiliate members are subject to additional terms as provided on the Teltik Communications affiliate pages. These T&amp;Cs do not alter the terms of the Affiliate Member Agreement, or any other agreement the user may have with Teltik Communications.</span><span ><br></span><span >You and any authorized users on your account will have access to account information and may be able to make changes to the account. If you give your personal account validation information to someone, they can access and make changes to your account. Those changes will be binding on you. Authorized changes may require your agreement to new or revised T&amp;Cs. You must provide accurate and truthful information when setting up an account, maintain security of the account and password, and you agree to notify Teltik Communications of any security breaches associated with your account. You agree to take responsibility for all activities that occur under this account.</span><span ><br></span><span >1. Acceptance. Your Agreement with Teltik Communications starts when you accept. You represent that you are at least 18 years old and you are legally authorized to enter into this Agreement. You accept your Agreement by doing any of the following: (a) giving us a written or electronic signature, clicking the acceptance box during the online enrollment process or telling us orally that you accept; (b) activating Service; (c) using your Service after you make a change or addition; (d) paying for the Service; (e) opening the box or package of a Device or sim card purchased from Teltik Communications or any of its 3rd party partners or vendors (&quot;Teltik Communications Device&quot;) ; or (f) failing to activate Service within 30 days after the initial purchase (a purchase of a Teltik Communications Device, unless returned within the Cancellation Period (as defined in Section 5)). IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO ACCEPT, THEN DO NOT DO ANY OF THESE THINGS AND IMMEDIATELY DISCONTINUE USE OF THE SERVICE.</span><span ><br></span><span >2. Teltik Communications Service, Teltik Communications is an Authorized UVNV Reseller. The Service includes wireless mobile phone service in the United States (including Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands). This means the following: (a) voice service includes unlimited incoming calls and unlimited outgoing calls to any domestic U.S. phone number from inside the United States; (b) unlimited incoming text messages and unlimited outgoing texts to any domestic and select international mobile numbers (included international countries are listed below) from inside the United States, and picture and video messages within the United States; and (c) no additional charges regardless of the amount of data used within the United States. The Service may be offered at differing prices under different Service Plans, depending on the data speed you desire and other factors. Rate of speeds will reduce when the amount of data used exceeds the amount allotted under your Service Plan. Speeds reduce to a 2G data experience in these situations. In addition, when roaming domestically, speeds are usually limited to up to 2G speeds (approximately 128 Kbps). Data usage is reset monthly on varied dates and does not necessarily match the monthly billing date for that line. To know when this date is for your line, contact Teltik by email, phone or chat.</span><span ><br></span><span >3. Service Availability. Coverage maps only approximate our anticipated wireless coverage area outdoors; actual Service area, coverage and quality may vary and change without notice depending on a variety of factors including network capacity, terrain and weather. Outages and interruptions in Service may occur, and speed of Service varies. You agree that we are not liable for problems relating to Service availability or quality.</span><span ><br></span><span >4. Monthly Fees and Payment. Teltik Communications provides the Service for a flat fee on a monthly, pay-in-advance basis under various Service Plans. Service begins when you pay the monthly payment for the first month of Service, which includes the Teltik Communications Mobile Service Fee and the taxes and other assessments described in Section 6 and on our website at Teltik.com. Subsequent monthly payments are due by your monthly payment date, which occurs on each monthly anniversary of the date on which the first monthly payment is made. If you fail to make your monthly payment when it is due, your Service will be suspended until the payment is received. If you fail to make your monthly payment within 30 days after it is due, your Service will be terminated and your phone number will be lost. Fees are not refunded or prorated if Service is terminated before your next payment date. If your Service is terminated, your account will be cancelled and you will lose your Teltik Communications mobile phone number. You will be required to re-enroll as a new customer in order to resume Service. If your Service is suspended for non-payment your monthly payment date will not change (for example, if your original billing cycle started on the 1st and you reactivate Service on the 15th day of the month your billing cycle will remain on the 1st). In the event that your Account is terminated, you will be required to sign up as a new customer and we may not be able to offer you your existing number. You may change your payment method or other payment options by clicking &ldquo;Edit Billing Preferences&rdquo; when you log in to your teltik.com portal. Usage details for each line is available upon request.</span><span ><br></span><span >5. Cancellation and Returns. Cancellation of Service: You can cancel a new line of Service WITHIN SEVEN DAYS of activation, or 30 days in California (the &quot;Cancellation Period&quot;). A partial, prorated refund will only be issued upon request, for lines cancelled within the Cancellation Period. Device Refunds and Restocking Fees: To return any Teltik Communications Device you acquired at the time of enrollment, (excluding SIM cards which do not qualify for a refund,) you must return the device in its package with all original contents, undamaged and in good working condition with no material alterations to the device&#39;s hardware or software. If you return your device in a damaged, altered or destroyed condition, we may decline to accept the return of the device or charge you the cost of repairing the device, plus any shipping and handling charges.</span><span ><br></span><span >6. Taxes, Fees, and Surcharges. You agree to pay all taxes, fees and surcharges (the &quot;Fees&quot;) imposed by governments or governmental entities on you or us as a result of our providing the Service to you. We may not give advance notice of changes in Fees. To determine Fees, we will use the street address you identified as your Place of Primary Use (&quot;PPU&quot;). If you did not identify the correct PPU, or if you provided an address (such as a PO box) that is not a recognized street address, you may be assigned a default location for tax purposes. Any dispute of the jurisdiction assigned must be submitted within 60 days of the billing in which the Fees were assessed. Fees include (a) Government Taxes &amp; Fees.These Fees are typically imposed by jurisdictions directly on you, the user of the telecommunication services. Such Fees include, but are not limited to, sales tax; and (b) Other Surcharges. These surcharges include, but are not limited to, taxes that Teltik Communications incurs to provide the Service but are not government taxes or fees imposed directly on our customers that we must collect by law. Examples include, but are not limited to, federal or state Universal Service fees, regulatory fees, excise taxes and gross receipts taxes. These surcharges will apply whether or not you directly benefit from the programs, activities or services included in the surcharge. The components and amounts of the Fees are subject to change without notice.</span><span ><br></span><span >7. Unpaid Charges. If we do not receive payment in full for a Teltik Communications Device or sim, for the Service, or for any other amount owed to us by you (for example, in the case of a credit card chargeback in which a charge is disputed after you have received a Teltik Communications Device from us), you may be charged a late fee of the greater of 1.5% per month (18% annually) or $5 per month, subject to the maximum allowed by law. We may use all lawful means to collect the amount owed and seek the return of any Device or service for which payment has not been received. If you fail to pay fees or any other amounts owed to Teltik Communications under this agreement and Teltik Communications refers your accounts(s) to a third party for collection, then Teltik Communications will also charge you a collection fee at the maximum percentage permitted by applicable law, but not to exceed 18%, to cover Teltik Communications&#39; collection-related costs. If we accept late or partial payments, we do not waive our right to collect all amounts that you owe, including late fees. If any payment is dishonored or returned for any reason, we may charge you the maximum amount allowed under applicable law.</span><span ><br></span><span >8. Your Right to Dispute Charges. Unless otherwise provided by law, you agree to notify us of any dispute regarding amounts owed to us within 60 days after the date you first incur the disputed amount. If you do not notify us of your dispute in writing within this time period, you may not pursue a claim in arbitration or in court. If you accept a credit, refund or other compensation or benefit to resolve a disputed amount, you agree that the issue is fully and finally resolved. For unresolved disputes see Section 26. To contact or notify us, see Section 15.</span><span ><br></span><span >Credit Card Chargebacks</span><span ><br></span><span >If we have charged your registered payment method for a charge that we deem is authorized and valid under these Terms, and your credit card company or other payment provider subsequently withholds or revokes such payment to us because the charge has been disputed by you (a &quot;Chargeback&quot;), we reserve the right to suspend your access to the affected Services until the Chargeback is reversed or in the case of a billing dispute, the billing dispute is resolved as set forth in these Terms.</span><span ><br></span><span >9. Our Rights to Make Changes. Your Service is subject to our business policies, practices, and procedures, which we can change without notice. AS PROVIDED ABOVE, WE CAN CHANGE ANY TERMS IN THE AGREEMENT AT ANY TIME.</span><span ><br></span><span >10. International Long-Distance Calls. Although Teltik Communications attempts to block all long distance calling, certain territories cannot be blocked and you are therefore fully responsible for any charges that are incurred, plus 5% taxes and fees. Teltik Communications reserves the right to pursue as well as bill the credit card you have on file.</span><span ><br></span><span >11. Your Phone Number, Your Device, and Compatibility with Other Networks. Except for any legal right you may have to port or transfer your phone number, you will acquire no ownership rights in any number assigned to you. The wireless telecommunications networks used to provide the Service (the &quot;Teltik Communications Network&quot;) are owned and operated by other licensed entities, not Teltik Communications. Your Teltik Communications Devices may not be compatible with the network and services provided by another service provider. Devices not purchased through Teltik Communications or its affiliates (&quot;Non-Teltik Communications Devices&quot;) must be compatible with the Teltik Communications Network or UVNV, Inc. for use with the Services, and such devices may not work on the Teltik Communications Network. A Teltik Communications Device is approved by Teltik Communications only for use with Teltik Communications Service. Please note that in order to port out your number, your account must be in active status (not closed or suspended). Lines that are in suspended status due to non payment or any other reason or not active are NOT eligible to be ported out.</span><span ><br></span><span >Network. At times we may remotely change software, systems, applications, features or programming on your Device without notice to address security, safety or other issues that impact the Teltik Communications network or your Device. These changes will modify your Device and may affect or erase data you have stored on your Device, the way you have programmed your Device, or the way you use your Device. We may offer you changes to systems, applications, features or programming remotely to your Device; you will not be able to use your Device during the installation of the changes even for emergencies.</span><span ><br></span><span >12. Roaming. Your Device may connect to another provider&#39;s network (&quot;Off-Net&quot;) even when you are within the Teltik Communications coverage area. You must use your Device predominantly within the Teltik Communications Network coverage area. If your Off-Net voice usage or messaging usage exceeds an acceptable level, it may be necessary to terminate your service. We may terminate your Service in our discretion and without prior notice if you no longer reside in a Teltik Communications Network coverage area, if your Off-Net usage makes it uneconomical for Teltik Communications to provide Service to you, or if required under Teltik Communications&rsquo; arrangements with its service providers. For data use while roaming, the limit is 50MB. Please note that for international roaming, the origination and/or number dialed may or may not be available. This data is conveyed by 3rd party roaming partners and is not always provided. In the event that the information is NOT provided, you are still responsible for the calls made/received in terms of billing. The duration and time stamp can always be provided upon request.</span><span ><br></span><span >13. Important Emergency and 9-1-1 Information. When making a 9-1-1 call, always state the nature of your emergency and provide both your location and phone number, as the operator may not automatically receive this information. Teltik Communications is not responsible for failures to connect or complete 9-1-1 calls or if inaccurate location information is provided. 9-1-1 service may not be available or reliable and your ability to receive emergency services may be impeded. We may use a variety of information and methods to determine the location of a 9-1-1 call, including Global Positioning Satellites, or our wireless network. Even with this information, an emergency operator may not be able to locate you in order to provide emergency services. Other third party entities are involved in connecting a 9-1-1 call and Teltik Communications does not determine the public safety agency to which your 9-1-1 call is routed. If you are porting a phone number to or from us, we may not be able to provide you with some Services, such as 9-1-1 location services, while the port is being implemented. Furthermore, Teltik Communications&#39; cloud phone service does not provide access to 911 or emergency services and therefore neither Teltik Communication nor its officers or employees may be held liable for any claim, damage, or loss (including, without limitation, attorneys&#39; fees) by, or on behalf of, you or any third &shy;party user of relating to the fact that Teltik Communications&#39; cloud phone service does not provide access to 911 or emergency services. You waive all claims or causes of action, whether in contract, warranty, tort (including negligence), or any other form of liability, arising from or relating to the fact that Teltik Communications&#39; cloud phone service does not provide access to 911 emergency service.</span><span ><br></span><span >14. Data Usage and Other Features. Permissible and Prohibited Uses: The Teltik Communications Network is managed to facilitate the proper functioning of the Network as a whole and to provide a good experience to the majority of our customers. Services that require consistent high speeds, such as video calling, may, particularly at times and in areas of network congestion, result in reduced speeds for other services. Additionally, we may implement other network management practices, such as caching less data, using less capacity, and sizing video more appropriately for a Device to transmit data files more efficiently. These practices are agnostic to the content itself and to the websites that provide it. While we avoid changing text, image, and video files in the compression process when practical, the process may impact the appearance of files as displayed on your Device. Downloadable Content and Applications: Most content or applications (e.g. downloadable or networked applications, wallpapers, ringtones, games, and productivity tools) (&quot;Content &amp; Apps&quot;) are not sold by Teltik Communications, and Teltik Communications is not responsible for the Content &amp; Apps, including download, installation, use, transmission failure, interruption, or delay, or any content or web site you may be able to access through the Content &amp; Apps. Unless otherwise stated, any support questions for these Content &amp; Apps must be directed to the third party seller. Teltik Communications has done its best to block access to premium (billable) services, however should you incur any charges, Teltik Communications will charge the credit card on file, or collect from you, the price incurred, plus 5% taxes and fees. You may be able to restrict access and certain services by implementing controls by calling Teltik Communications. When you use, download or install Content &amp; Apps sold by a third party seller, you may be subject to license terms between you and third parties. When you use, download, or install Content &amp; Apps that you purchase from Teltik Communications, the Content &amp; Apps are licensed to you by Teltik Communications and may be subject to additional license terms between you and third parties. You may not transfer, copy, distribute, or reverse engineer any Content &amp; Apps, or alter, disable or circumvent any digital rights management security features embedded in the Content &amp; Apps. Content &amp; Apps may not be transferable from one Device to another Device. Some Devices or Content &amp; Apps may continue to have contact with our network without your knowledge, which may result in additional Charges. Software on your Device may automatically shut down or limit the use of Content &amp; Apps or other features or Services without warning. Teltik Communications is not responsible for any third party content, advertisements, or websites you may be able to access using your Device. Use of Information: You agree that Teltik Communications may update your Content &amp; Apps remotely, or may disable or remove any Content &amp; Apps at any time. Refer to Teltik Communications&#39; Privacy Policy below, as well as the Content &amp; Apps creator/owner&#39;s privacy policy for information regarding their use of information collected when you download, install, or use any third party Content &amp; Apps. We are not responsible for any transmission failure, interruption, or delay related to Content &amp; Apps, or any content or website you may be able to access through the Content &amp; Apps.</span><span ><br></span><span >15.

You expressly consent to be contacted by Teltik Communications, your referring affiliate or our partner, for any and all purposes, at any telephone number, email address or physical address you provide to us or that we provide to you.

Once you notify us, we will suspend your Service. After your Service is suspended, you will still be responsible for additional monthly payments. If you request that we not suspend your Service, you will remain responsible for payments for all services used from your account. We may prevent a lost or stolen Device from registering on any network</span><span ><br></span><span >17. Misuse of Service or Device &ndash; Your Representation.

THIS MEANS THAT NEITHER OF US WILL SEEK ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, TREBLE, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES FROM THE OTHER. THIS LIMITATION SPECIFICALLY INCLUDES LACK OF RECOVERY FOR LOSS OF ANTICIPATED BENEFITS OR MONEY, LOSS OF DATA, ANY DOWNTIME LOSS, OR ANY OTHER SIMILAR DAMAGES YOU MAY SUFFER TO YOURSELF OR YOUR PROPERTY. THIS LIMITATION AND WAIVER ALSO APPLIES TO ANY CLAIMS YOU MAY BRING AGAINST ANY OTHER PARTY TO THE EXTENT THAT WE WOULD BE REQUIRED TO INDEMNIFY THAT PARTY FOR SUCH CLAIM. YOU AGREE WE ARE NOT LIABLE FOR PROBLEMS CAUSED BY YOU OR A THIRD PARTY, OR FOR PROBLEMS CAUSED BY TELTIK COMMUNICATIONS&#39; SERVICE, DEVICE, OR ANY OTHER ASPECT OF ITS BUSINESS. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT PROHIBITED BY LAW, ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT WITHIN 2 YEARS OF THE DATE THE CLAIM ARISES. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW SUCH LIMITS ON LIABILITY SO THESE LIMITS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</span><span ><br></span><span >25. Indemnification. You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold us harmless from any claims arising out of use of the Service or Devices, breach of the T&amp;Cs and all representations and warranties herein, or violation of any laws or regulations or the rights of any third party by you or any person on your account or that you allow to use your Service or Device.</span><span ><br></span><span >26. Dispute Resolution and Arbitration. WE EACH AGREE THAT, EXCEPT AS PROVIDED BELOW, ANY AND ALL CLAIMS OR DISPUTES IN ANY WAY RELATED TO OR CONCERNING THE T&amp;CS, OUR SERVICES, DEVICES OR PRODUCTS, INCLUDING ANY BILLING DISPUTES, WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING ARBITRATION OR IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT. This includes any claims against other parties relating to Services or Devices provided or billed to you (such as our affiliates) whenever you also assert claims against us in the same proceeding. We each also agree that the T&amp;Cs affect interstate commerce so that the Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply. THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS LIMITED. THE ARBITRATOR MUST FOLLOW THIS AGREEMENT.</span><span ><br></span><span >For all disputes, whether pursued in court or arbitration, you must first give us an opportunity to resolve your claim by sending us a written description of your claim as provided in Section 15 below. We each agree to negotiate your claim in good faith. If we are unable to resolve the claim within 60 days after we receive this claim description, you may pursue your claim in arbitration. We each agree that if you fail to pay amounts due on a timely basis, we may assign your account for collection, and the collection agency may pursue, in small claims court, claims limited strictly to the collection of the past due amounts and any interest or cost of collection permitted by law or the Agreement.</span><span ><br></span><span >Either you or we may start arbitration proceedings. You must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to our registered agent as provided in Section 15 to begin arbitration. The American Arbitration Association (AAA) will arbitrate all disputes. For claims of less than $75,000, the AAA&#39;s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes will apply; for claims over $75,000, the AAA&#39;s Commercial Arbitration Rules will apply. The AAA rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. All fees and expenses of arbitration will be divided between you and Teltik Communications in accordance with the AAA Rules, except that Teltik Communications will reimburse you for the amount of the filing fee in the event you prevail in the arbitration. Each party will bear the expenses of its own counsel, experts, witnesses, and preparation and presentation of evidence. Except as otherwise provided in these T&amp;Cs, an arbitrator may award on an individual basis any relief that would be available in a court, including injunctive or declaratory relief and attorneys&rsquo; fees. If for any reason this arbitration provision is deemed inapplicable or invalid, or to the extent this arbitration provision allows for litigation of disputes in court, you waive to the fullest extent permitted by law any claims for punitive or exemplary damages. Unless Teltik Communications and you agree otherwise, the location of any arbitration shall be New Jersey. Except where prohibited by law, Teltik Communications and you agree that no arbitrator has the authority to award punitive damages or any other damages not measured by the prevailing party&#39;s actual damages. Neither you nor Teltik Communications shall disclose the existence, contents, or results of any arbitration except to the extent required by law. Judgment on the award rendered may be entered by any court having jurisdiction thereof.</span><span ><br></span><span >CLASS ACTION WAIVER. WE EACH AGREE THAT ANY PROCEEDINGS WILL BE CONDUCTED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT IN A CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR AS A MEMBER IN A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. If a court or arbitrator determines in an action between you and us that this Class Action Waiver is unenforceable, the arbitration agreement will be void as to you.</span><span ><br></span><span >JURY TRIAL WAIVER. If a claim proceeds in court rather than through arbitration, WE EACH WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.</span><span ><br></span><span >27. Enforceability and Assignment. A waiver of any part of the Agreement in one instance is not a waiver of any other part or any other instance and must be expressly provided in writing. If we don&#39;t enforce our rights under any provisions of the Agreement, we may still require strict compliance in the future. Except as provided in Section 26, if any part of the Agreement is held invalid that part may be severed from the Agreement. You may not assign the Agreement or any of your rights or duties under it without our written consent. We may assign all or part of the Agreement or your debts to us without notice. The Agreement is the entire agreement between us and defines all of the rights you have with respect to your Service or Device, except as provided by law, and you cannot rely on any other documents or statements by any sales, service representatives, Teltik Communications Members, UVNV, Inc. or other parties. If you purchase a Device, services or content from a third party, you may have a separate agreement with the third party; Teltik Communications is not a party to that agreement. The original version of these T&amp;Cs is in English. To the extent there are conflicts between the English version and any other language version, the English version will control. Any determination made by us pursuant to these T&amp;Cs, shall be in our sole reasonable discretion. The following paragraphs continue after termination of our T&amp;Cs with you: 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, &nbsp;20, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27 and 28.</span><span ><br></span><span >28. Choice of Law. These T&amp;Cs are governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, applicable federal law, and the laws of the state of New Jersey without regard to the conflicts of laws rules of that state. Foreign laws do not apply. Arbitration or court proceedings must be in Middlesex County, New Jersey. If any provision of the T&amp;Cs is invalid under the law of a particular jurisdiction, that provision will not apply in that jurisdiction.</span><span ><br></span><span >29. Teltik Communications&#39; Cloud Phone Service.

        <p dir="ltr"></p>
        <p dir="ltr">Effective Date: December 2020</p>
        <p dir="ltr" ><span >Teltik Communications Inc. (&quot;Teltik Communications&quot;) has instituted a comprehensive set of privacy policies and procedures to ensure that its customers and website visitors&#39; privacy is never compromised. The purpose of this privacy notice is to inform our customers and website visitors of the type of information that Teltik Communications, or a credit card processing partner or other vendor acting on our behalf, collects, how the information is gathered, how it is utilized, how long it is retained and how customers and visitors can restrict its use or disclosure.</span><span ><br></span><span >The primary focus of Teltik Communications&#39; privacy policy is to ensure that all customers and website visitors&#39; personal information, which we term &quot;customer identifiable information,&quot; is kept private at all times. As the term suggests, &quot;customer identifiable information&quot; is information which can be associated with a specific individual or entity, including, for example, a customer&#39;s name, date of birth, address, telephone number, e-mail address and sensitive information such as credit card information.</span><span ><br><br></span></p>
<p dir="ltr" ><span >The collection of customer identifiable information is a critical element in Teltik Communications&#39; day-to-day operations in order to conduct business and offer services and to maintain the highest level of customer service for all customers and website visitors.</span><span ><br></span><span >Teltik Communications endeavors to safeguard the customer identifiable information obtained from its website users and visitors (collectively, &quot;customers&quot;) from any unauthorized intrusions.</span><span ><br></span><span >General</span><span ><br><br></span></p>
<p dir="ltr" ><span >We collect personal and non-personal information from customers based upon our business relationship and the nature of the products and services we provide. The types of information we may collect include account information (such as your name, address, home or alternate telephone number), certain financial information relating to any products and/or services that you purchase directly from us (including credit card information, security code and billing address), telephone numbers you call and that have called you and your service history, amongst other information. We also collect and maintain technical information about the equipment you use with our service including serial numbers, SIM card numbers, etc.</span><span ><br></span><span >In some instances, Teltik Communications may collect information that is not &quot;customer identifiable information.&quot; Some examples of this type of information include the type of Internet browser you are using, the type of operating system you have configured on your computer, and the domain name of the website and/or Internet Service Provider from which you are linked to our website. Teltik Communications primarily uses this information for market research and optimizing its systems in order to deliver the best customer experience possible.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" ><span ><br></span><span >Teltik Communications may collect and use customer identifiable information for various purposes, including but not limited to, billing purposes such as the auto-refill program, to provide or change service, to anticipate and resolve problems with your service, or to inform you of products and services that better meet your needs. This means that Teltik Communications may use your customer identifiable information in conjunction with information available from other sources, to market new services that may be of interest to you. When Teltik Communications uses third parties to perform services on its behalf, such as marketing, fulfillment services and shipping to customers, Teltik Communications will request that such third parties protect your customer identifiable information consistently with this privacy policy. Teltik Communications will not, however, disclose your customer identifiable information to third parties who want to market products to you without your express, written or equivalent electronic consent. Teltik Communications will not sell, trade, or disclose to third parties any customer identifiable information derived from the registration for, or use of, a Teltik Communications product or service -- including customer names and addresses -- without the consent of the customer.</span></p>
<p><span ><br></span><span >Teltik Communications may, however, use and/or disclose customer identifiable information to a third party:</span><span ><br></span><span >&bull; to investigate and help prevent potential fraud, other unlawful activity or activity that threatens the network;</span><span ><br></span><span >&bull; as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process;</span><span ><br></span><span >&bull; when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request;</span><span ><br></span><span >&bull; to any other third party with your prior consent to do so;</span><span ><br></span><span >&bull; if Teltik Communications is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, you will be notified via a prominent notice on our Website of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information.</span><span ><br></span><span >We will retain your information only as long as needed for business, tax and/or legal purposes. We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce our agreements. We will destroy your information once it is no longer needed.</span><span ><br></span><span >Declining e-mail offers</span><span ><br></span><span >Teltik Communications will only send our customers e-mails regarding promotional offers or other news if a customer grants us permission to do so and provides an email address.
