                    <p>International Roaming is disabled on all voice lines, and is available upon request. Data-only lines are enabled by default. <br>
                        <br> In order to enable International Roaming please send us a request to support@teltik.com and we will respond shortly after with the International Roaming Terms. Once you respond with your consent, we will enable International
                        Roaming on your line.<br>
                        <br> International Roaming cannot be enabled within the first 30 days of service.<br>
                        <br> Please note that data and text is free in the included countries (see list of countries below). In addition, calls made through WiFi Calling back to the US only, are free as well.<br>
                        <br> However, calls made over CELLULAR connection while roaming outside the US or Canada, including incoming and outgoing calls, as well as voicemail retrieval, are not free and will be charged $0.35 per minute.<br>
                        <br> International Roaming will be enabled for a period of 30 days. If you plan to make frequent trips abroad and would like it enabled for a longer period of time, please let us know.<br>
                        <br> For support while roaming, call T-Mobile's International Support desk. Dial +1-505-998-3793 (this is a FREE call from your T-Mobile phone) or 001-505-998-3793 (from a land-line).<br>
                        <br> Please note: International Roaming includes voice, text and data. However, even when this feature is enabled, it will only work in certain countries and certain parts of the world. There are places throughout the world that

                        <br> 1. Click sign in<br> 2. Log in with your credentials<br> 3. Under Monthly Billing, locate the phone number that you would like to change the plan for.<br> 4. Click the drop down on the right hand side of that number<br> 5.
                        Select the 'Change my plan' option<br> 6. Continue through the steps as prompted <br>
                        <br> If upgrading, the new plan will be applied to that line. The change will take effect within several hours. In addition, your card on file will get charged the price difference for the upgrade added. For example, if you are
                        on the $25 plan, your billing cycle is on the 1st of the month, and on the 15th you upgrade to the $30 plan, the difference is $5. You will be charged the entire difference, which will cover you until the end of the month. Upon
                        the next billing cycle, you will get charged the new rate.<br>
                        <br> If downgrading, the effect will only take place at the beginning of the next upcoming billing cycle, at which point you will be charged the new rate.</p>

                <div class="answer">
                    <p>Yes. Your data will never be cut off. <br>
                        <br> All our plans include UNLIMITED talk, text, and data. However, amount of 4G LTE - High-speed data is subject to the package you choose. After you run out of your allotted amount, you will be throttled to slower speeds but
                        still be connected.<br>
                        <br> For the Unlimited LTE plans, you get unlimited 4G LTE - High-speed data. However, during times of congestion, it is subject to network deprioritization (currently estimated at approximately 50GB). <br>
                        <br> To explain, if you use more than 50GB of data in one cycle, your data usage will be prioritized below others for the remainder of that data cycle. The only time that you’re likely to see the effects of that, though, is when
                        you’re at a location on the network that is congested, during which time you may see slower speeds. Once you move to a different location or the congestion goes down, your speeds will likely go back up. And once the new data cycle
                        rolls around, your usage will be reset.</p>

                    <p>Great question! The choice is yours. You may either purchase a SIM card though Teltik, or you may bring your own SIM.<br>
                        <br> Please note: Should you choose to bring your own SIM, it MUST meet the following two criteria:<br>
                        <br> 1. It MUST be T-Mobile branded (not co-branded/MVNO)<br> 2. It MUST be new and unused. <br>
                        <br> The SIM card will not work if these conditions are not met.<br>
                        <br> The option to choose whether to use your own SIM or purchase one through Teltik is asked during signup.</p>

                <h2>When will my SIM card get shipped?<i>.</i></h2>
                <div class="answer">
                    <p>SIM cards are shipped out the same business day, providing the order is placed before 1:30PM. During holidays and weekends, shipments will be sent out within 48 hours. <br>
                        <br> SIM cards are shipped via USPS. However, if you are trying to "time" your order to coincide with the end of a billing cycle, give yourself a little leeway so that there is no lapse in service. If porting, ensure that you have
                        enough time to receive your SIM and port your number over before your current carriers billing cycle is up. Porting out of a inactive account is blocked by many carriers. <br>
                        <br> Once shipped, you will receive a tracking number via email.<br>

                <div class="answer">
                    <p>Third party billing is blocked as much as possible to protect your account. Many clients have successfully been using Google Voice to receive short code messages and this has been working well for them. Should you accrue any third
                        party charges, they will be added to your account + 5% covering taxes and fees, and automatically charged on your next invoice.</p>

                <div class="answer">
                    <p>Creating an account with us by placing your first order will give you a Telecommunications Business Package. All packages will include whichever wireless plans you select, as well as our powerful Business Cloud-phone system - ON US!<br>
                        <br> The process for getting started is as follows:<br>
                        <br> 1. Start off by going to the Plans page, either by clicking 'PLANS' on the top of the page, or from the homepage, by clicking 'EXPLORE PLANS'<br>
                        <br> 2. Next, look through the various wireless plans. They differ by price and amount of 4G LTE data. Meaning, all wireless plans include unlimited talk, text, and data, as well as all the other cool features. (See Mobility features
                        by clicking the 'WIRELESS MOBILITY FEATURES' link on the top of the Plans page.) The amount of 4G LTE - or "fast" - data is subject to the package you choose. However, after you run out of your allotted amount, you will be throttled
                        to slower speeds but still always be connected.<br>
                        <br> 3. Once you click 'Select' on the plan you want, a pop-up will appear. This pop-up will ask for some details, as well as offer you some features. Here is where you choose if you'll be bringing your own SIM card or getting
                        the special 3-in-1 SIM from us. You will also tell us if you're porting a number from another carrier, or if not, you'll be able to enter a desired area code. You can also choose to opt-in to some of the cool add-on features like
                        Stateside International Calling, and Name ID. There are optional features. When you're ready click 'ADD THIS PLAN' on the right.<br>
                        <br> 4. At this point you will be brought back to the Plans page. You will notice the plan you just selected in your cart on the right. At this point you have the option to add another line to your order by selecting another wireless
                        plan and repeating the same steps, or click 'NEXT STEP' on the right, at the bottom of your cart. <br>
                        <br> 5. At this point you need to verify your business. Fill in your business information, and upload the necessary documents. When you're ready, click 'NEXT STEP' or 'VERIFY MY BUSINESS'. Your information will be submitted and
                        one of our team members will verify your business. Don't worry, once you're verified your order will still be in your cart. If accepted, you should receive an email from us within an hour, with a link to proceed with your order.<br>
                        <br> 6. Once verified, you will receive an email with a link that will re-direct you to the next step in placing your order. Click 'NEXT STEP' on the right-hand side to continue. On the next page, create a password and 4-digit
                        PIN. The password will be used for you to login to your online account, and the PIN will be used whenever you want to make changes to your account by phone, by chat, or by email. Further on the same page you will enter your personal
                        information including billing and shipping info. When you’re ready, click ‘Next Step’.<br>
                        <br> 7. On the next page you will be able to review your order, and edit your cart. You can choose to add a line, or change some details on an existing line. You can also enter a discount code if you have one. Further down the
                        page you will enter your credit card info, and when you’ve done that you can click ‘PLACE ORDER’. (Please note, by placing your order, you agree to Teltik's privacy notice and conditions of use.)<br>
                        <br> 8. Your first order has now been placed. You will receive a confirmation email shortly after. The email will also include information on how to setup your cloud-based phone system. <br>

                        was used on the account will get charged. You can also update the credit card on file by clicking "Edit Billing Preferences" and entering it there. <br>
                        <br> Avoid having to manually login and make a payment, or interruption of service due to late payment, by using our "AutoPay" feature on the billing preferences page, and the monthly payment will be pulled each month automatically.
                        When enrolled in AutoPay, your payment will be pulled two days before it is due, to leave room for error and avoid interruption of service. (Please note: If you enroll in AutoPay within two days of your billing due date, it will
                        not pull on the upcoming bill, and only take effect in the following one.)<br>

                    <p>Upgrading and downgrading plans as well as adding or removing features is really simple.<br>
                        <br> 1. Click sign in<br> 2. Log in with your credentials<br> 3. Under Monthly Billing, locate the phone number that you would like to change the plan for.<br> 4. Click the drop down on the right hand side of that number<br> 5.
                        Select the 'Change my plan' option<br> 6. Continue through the steps as prompted <br>
                        <br> If upgrading, the new plan will be applied to that line. The change will take effect within several hours. In addition, your card on file will get charged the price difference for the upgrade added. For example, if you are
                        on the $25 plan, your billing cycle is on the 1st of the month, and on the 15th you upgrade to the $30 plan, the difference is $5. You will be charged the entire difference, which will cover you until the end of the month. Upon
                        the next billing cycle, you will get charged the new rate.<br>
                        <br> If downgrading, the effect will only take place at the beginning of the next upcoming billing cycle, at which point you will be charged the new rate.</p>

                <div class="answer">
                    <p>Our plans are prepaid, which means you pay ahead of the coming month. Should payment not be made, the line will be temporarily suspended until payment is made. After 14 days of no payment, the line will be closed permanently, which
                        can result in the loss of the phone number. </p>

                <div class="answer">
                    <p>First, log in to your account using your email address and password, then click "Make Payment" on the left. When you process a payment, the credit card that you used when service was initially established, or the last credit card that
                        was used on the account will get charged. You can also update the credit card on file by clicking "Edit Billing Preferences" and entering it there. <br>
                        <br> Avoid having to manually login and make a payment, or interruption of service due to late payment, by using our "AutoPay" feature on the billing preferences page, and the monthly payment will be pulled each month automatically.
                        When enrolled in AutoPay, your payment will be pulled two days before it is due, to leave room for error and avoid interruption of service. (Please note: If you enroll in AutoPay within two days of your billing due date, it will
                        not pull on the upcoming bill, and only take effect in the following one.)</p>

                <div class="answer">
                    <p>Upgrading and downgrading plans as well as adding or removing features is really simple.<br>
                        <br> 1. Click sign in<br> 2. Log in with your credentials<br> 3. Under Monthly Billing, locate the phone number that you would like to change the plan for.<br> 4. Click the drop down on the right hand side of that number<br> 5.
                        Select the 'Change my plan' option<br> 6. Continue through the steps as prompted <br>
                        <br> If upgrading, the new plan will be applied to that line. The change will take effect within several hours. In addition, your card on file will get charged the price difference for the upgrade added. For example, if you are
                        on the $25 plan, your billing cycle is on the 1st of the month, and on the 15th you upgrade to the $30 plan, the difference is $5. You will be charged the entire difference, which will cover you until the end of the month. Upon
                        the next billing cycle, you will get charged the new rate.<br>
                        <br> If downgrading, the effect will only take place at the beginning of the next upcoming billing cycle, at which point you will be charged the new rate.</p>

                <div class="answer">
                    <p>Creating an account with us by placing your first order will give you a Telecommunications Business Package. All packages will include whichever wireless plans you select, as well as our powerful Business Cloud-phone system - ON US!<br>
                        <br> The process for getting started is as follows:<br>
                        <br> 1. Start off by going to the Plans page, either by clicking 'PLANS' on the top of the page, or from the homepage, by clicking 'EXPLORE PLANS'<br>
                        <br> 2. Next, look through the various wireless plans. They differ by price and amount of 4G LTE data. Meaning, all wireless plans include unlimited talk, text, and data, as well as all the other cool features. (See Mobility features
                        by clicking the 'WIRELESS MOBILITY FEATURES' link on the top of the Plans page.) The amount of 4G LTE - or "fast" - data is subject to the package you choose. However, after you run out of your allotted amount, you will be throttled
                        to slower speeds but still always be connected.<br>
                        <br> 3. Once you click 'Select' on the plan you want, a pop-up will appear. This pop-up will ask for some details, as well as offer you some features. Here is where you choose if you'll be bringing your own SIM card or getting
                        the special 3-in-1 SIM from us. You will also tell us if you're porting a number from another carrier, or if not, you'll be able to enter a desired area code. You can also choose to opt-in to some of the cool add-on features like
                        Stateside International Calling, and Name ID. There are optional features. When you're ready click 'ADD THIS PLAN' on the right.<br>
                        <br> 4. At this point you will be brought back to the Plans page. You will notice the plan you just selected in your cart on the right. At this point you have the option to add another line to your order by selecting another wireless
                        plan and repeating the same steps, or click 'NEXT STEP' on the right, at the bottom of your cart. <br>
                        <br> 5. At this point you need to verify your business. Fill in your business information, and upload the necessary documents. When you're ready, click 'NEXT STEP' or 'VERIFY MY BUSINESS'. Your information will be submitted and
                        one of our team members will verify your business. Don't worry, once you're verified your order will still be in your cart. If accepted, you should receive an email from us within an hour, with a link to proceed with your order.<br>
                        <br> 6. Once verified, you will receive an email with a link that will re-direct you to the next step in placing your order. Click 'NEXT STEP' on the right-hand side to continue. On the next page, create a password and 4-digit
                        PIN. The password will be used for you to login to your online account, and the PIN will be used whenever you want to make changes to your account by phone, by chat, or by email. Further on the same page you will enter your personal
                        information including billing and shipping info. When you’re ready, click ‘Next Step’.<br>
                        <br> 7. On the next page you will be able to review your order, and edit your cart. You can choose to add a line, or change some details on an existing line. You can also enter a discount code if you have one. Further down the
                        page you will enter your credit card info, and when you’ve done that you can click ‘PLACE ORDER’. (Please note, by placing your order, you agree to Teltik's privacy notice and conditions of use.)<br>
                        <br> 8. Your first order has now been placed. You will receive a confirmation email shortly after. The email will also include information on how to setup your cloud-based phone system. <br>

                    <p>SIM cards are shipped out the same business day, providing the order is placed before 1:30PM. During holidays and weekends, shipments will be sent out within 48 hours. <br>
                        <br> SIM cards are shipped via USPS. However, if you are trying to "time" your order to coincide with the end of a billing cycle, give yourself a little leeway so that there is no lapse in service. If porting, ensure that you have
                        enough time to receive your SIM and port your number over before your current carriers billing cycle is up. Porting out of a inactive account is blocked by many carriers. <br>
                        <br> Once shipped, you will receive a tracking number via email.<br>

                    <p>Great question! The choice is yours. You may either purchase a SIM card though Teltik, or you may bring your own SIM.<br>
                        <br> Please note: Should you choose to bring your own SIM, it MUST meet the following two criteria:<br>
                        <br> 1. It MUST be T-Mobile branded (not co-branded/MVNO)<br> 2. It MUST be new and unused. <br>
                        <br> The SIM card will not work if these conditions are not met.<br>
                        <br> The option to choose whether to use your own SIM or purchase one through Teltik is asked during signup.</p>

                <h2>Is my data really always unlimited?<i>.</i></h2>
                <div class="answer">
                    <p>Yes. Your data will never be cut off. <br>
                        <br> All our plans include UNLIMITED talk, text, and data. However, amount of 4G LTE - High-speed data is subject to the package you choose. After you run out of your allotted amount, you will be throttled to slower speeds but
                        still be connected.<br>
                        <br> For the Unlimited LTE plans, you get unlimited 4G LTE - High-speed data. However, during times of congestion, it is subject to network deprioritization (currently estimated at approximately 50GB). <br>
                        <br> To explain, if you use more than 50GB of data in one cycle, your data usage will be prioritized below others for the remainder of that data cycle. The only time that you’re likely to see the effects of that, though, is when
                        you’re at a location on the network that is congested, during which time you may see slower speeds. Once you move to a different location or the congestion goes down, your speeds will likely go back up. And once the new data cycle
                        rolls around, your usage will be reset.</p>

                        <br> Your card on file will automatically be charged for usage of services that are not included in your plan, including, but not limited to, the following: <br> 1) Calls to the Virgin Islands, or any international destination
                        with a +1 prefix, other than Canada (approx. $3.00/min, plus 5% covering taxes and fees, should you not have the Stateside International Calling plan).<br> 2) Calls from Canada to Mexico, or vice versa (approx. $3.00/min, plus

                <div class="answer">
                    <p>Porting over a new number can take up to 24 hours to go though fully. Time of porting will depend on how long it takes for the other carrier to release the line. Lines coming from one of the big carriers are usually released immediately.
                        Port-ins from landlines can take up to 2 weeks although they usually go through much sooner. Turning off the phone with the old provider could help as well.<br>
