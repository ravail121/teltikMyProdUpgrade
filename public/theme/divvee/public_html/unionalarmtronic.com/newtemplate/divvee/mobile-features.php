				<h3>No Contract</h3>
				<p>The world of business requires constant adaption. It's hard to know what the next week will bring, much less the next 2 years. So why would you ever want to be stuck in a 2-year contract? </p> 
				<p>Well, not anymore. GCN4Business gives you the flexibility to shift with the ever-changing tides of business ownership. When your needs change, your plan can change. Simple, easy, and hassle-free.</p> 

				<p>GCN4Business gives you the best of both worlds: The power and perks of a big corporate network plus the customer service and values that come from small business.   </p>

				<p>But what about my rates going up? Won't a contract lock in my price? Sure it will, but we guarantee your rate will never increase as long you're our customer. In fact, it may even go down. Try that with a contract.

				<h3>Bring Your Own Phone</h3>

				<p>With GCN4Business, you can bring your own phone. That means we don't add the cost of it into your monthly bill. So buy a phone from wherever you want and have it unlocked or call your current provider and have them unlock your phone. Then bring it over to GCN and start saving.</p>

				<h3>Hotspots</h3>
				<p>Working outside or out of range of WiFi? Some things just need to be done on a laptop. With free hotspot, you can tether any WiFi device and do what you need to when you 
need to. </p>

				<h3>Unlimited Data</h3>

				<p>All of our data plans include unlimited data. The only difference is the amount of 4G LTE data. So, you will NEVER be charged overages, but upon reaching data limits your speed is slowed up to 128 Kbps until the next billing cycle.</p>
